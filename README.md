XProc: An XML Pipeline Language
===============================

This repository is now abandoned.

Whatâ€™s here?
============

This repository contains the XProc language specification.

The XProc 1.0 specification is in the `xproc10` branch.

The XML-based XProc 2.0 specification is in the `xproc20` branch in
its last committed state.

The `master` branch contains only this README.

In February 2016, the Working Group concluded that its current efforts to
define _XProc 2.0_ as a refinement of the _XProc 1.0_ XML-based syntax
were not worth pursuing.

Some months later, the W3C closed the Working Group.

Work on XProc is now being undertaken by community volunteers. That
work is being tracked at https://github.com/xproc/1.1-specification
